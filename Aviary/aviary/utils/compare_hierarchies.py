def compare_inner_classes(class1, class2, show_all=False):
    """
    Compare two nested class hierarchies and return a set of shared inner-classes.

    Summary:
    This function takes in two classes that both are part of variable hierarchies and may contain
    inner-classes or variables with string-named values. This function compares those two classes
    and returns a set of inner classes that have the same name in both inputted classes. It will throw
    an error if the two classes have the same variable with a different string-named value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    class1 : class
        A class that is all or part of a variable hierarchy. This can be the top-level
        class in the hierarchy, or any inner class nested at any depth within that top-level class.
    class2 : class
        A class that is all or part of a variable hierarchy. This can be the top-level
        class in the hierarchy, or any inner class nested at any depth within that top-level class.
    show_all : bool, optional
        Flag to tell the function to return the sets of variables and inner classes for
        each provided class.

    Returns
    -------
    overlapping_inner_classes : set of strings
        A set of string names of all the inner classes which are common between the two
        input classes.
    class1_vars_set : set of strings, optional
        Set of string names of the variables belonging to class1, optional return based
        on show_all flag.
    class2_vars_set : set of strings, optional
        Set of string names of the variables belonging to class2, optional return based
        on show_all flag.
    class1_inner_classes_set : set of strings, optional
        Set of the string names of inner classes belonging to class1, optional return based
        on show_all flag.
    class2_inner_classes_set : set of strings, optional
        Set of the string names of inner classes belonging to class2, optional return based
        on show_all flag.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the two input classes both have a variable with the same variable name but
        different string-named value.

Then a sequence of core mission phases is added. In addition, if `mission_method` is {glue:md}`2DOF` and `ascent` is a phase, it adds an equality constraint to the problem to ensure that the velocity at the end of the groundroll phase is equal to the rotation velocity at the start of the rotation phase ({glue:md}`_add_groundroll_eq_constraint()`). If `mission_method` is {glue:md}`height_energy`, it sets up trajectory parameters by calling `setup_trajectory_params()`. If `mission_method` is {glue:md}`solved_2DOF`, it has a block of code to make sure that the trajectory is smooth by applying boundary constraints between phases (e.g. fuselage pitch angle or true airspeed).\n",

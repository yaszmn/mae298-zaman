Then the percentage of perimeter not buried in fuselage is $f(x) = 1 - \\arccos(2*(0.5 -x))/\\pi$. As we see, if the nacelle is not buried in fuselage at all, then $x = 0$ and $f(x) = 1$.

The primary goal is to compute the lift coefficient {glue:md}`CL` and the drag coefficient {glue:md}`CD`. Because of the shape of fuselage, the lift effect from the body can not be ignored. The main features are:\n",

    "**1. Computation of body form factor**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the computation of body form drag factor {glue:md}`Aircraft.Fuselage.FORM_FACTOR`, the fuselage fineness ratio is based on hydraulic diameter instead of fuselage average diameter. Let us denote the body form drag factor as `body_form_factor`. Then, it holds ${\\rm body\\_form\\_factor}(x) = 1 + 1.5x^{1.5} + 7x^3$, where $x = ({\\rm hydraulic diameter}) / ({\\rm fuselage length})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Computation of curve fitting correction factor for Oswald efficiency**\n",

    "In GASP and Aviary, there is a parameter named {glue:md}`siwb`. It is basically the curve fitting correction factor for Oswald efficiency and it holds ${\\rm siwb}(x) = 1 - 0.0088x - 1.7364x^2 - 2.303x^3 + 6.0606x^4$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For conventional aircraft, $x = ({\\rm cabin width}) / ({\\rm wing span})$. For BWB, $x$ is replaced by hydraulic diameter over wing span.\n",

    "**3. Computation of unified induced drag correction factor**\n",
    "\n",
    "In GASP and Aviary, there is a parameter named {glue:md}`ufac`. It is basically the unified induced drag correction factor. For conventional aircraft, this factor is usually around 1. For BWB aircraft, we need to set an upper limit 0.975.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three parameters above are fed into the main component {glue:md}`AeroGeom` of aero dynamics system {glue:md}`AeroSetup` for BWB aircraft. This system computes the drag parameters from cruise conditions and geometric parameters. The basic diagram is shown below:\n",

A new component {glue:md}`BWBBodyLiftCurveSlope` is added to compute the body lift curve slope ({glue:md}`body_lift_curve_slope`) of fuselage for a given Mach number. Suppose that we are given the lift curve slope (`CLALPH_B0` or {glue:md}`Aircraft.Fuselage.LIFT_CURVE_SLOPE_MACH0`) of fuselage at Mach 0, then for any given Mach, we define\n",

    "\n",
    "**5. Computation of lift coeficient from the wing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on whether it is during a cruise flight or low speed flight, the computations of lift coefficient are different. For cruise, the computation is relative clean while for low speed, we must take ground effect into considerations. The two situations are shown in the following two diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "For cruise:\n",

    "This model has its limitations. Generally speaking, it is good for number of passengers fewer than 250. There are other limitations. For detailed discussions, we refer readers to [theory guide](../../theory_guide/gasp_based_bwb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Computation of total lift coefficient**\n",
    "\n",
    "The total lift coefficient is a scaled sum of lift coeficient of the wings and the lift coefficient of the body. For the wing, the ratio of the exposed wing area vs the wing area scales the the lift coefficient of the wings. For the body, the ratio of planform area over the the wing area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GASP Based Aerodynamics using an aerodynamics table\n",
    "\n",
    "As we point out earlier, the designed maximum cruise Mach number should be less than or equal to 0.8. If the Mach number is greater than 0.8, the lift and drag coefficients can be computed using table based modeling {glue:md}`TabularCruiseAero`. Aero tables are usually the results of high fidelity CFD tools. Aviary provide a tool to convert GASP aero tables to Aviary format. In terms of the modeling, there is no special treatment for BWB aircraft than traditional aircraft."

    "# Payload Range Functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Payload Range functionality is currently available for the {glue:md}`height_energy` missions and FLOPS mass systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A payload-range diagram is an aircraft performance visualization that illustrates the trade-off between how much weight the aircraft can carry in terms of passengers and cargo (payload) vs how far it can fly (range).\n",
    "The payload-range shows 3 different points:\n",
    "- **Maximum Payload Point**: The maximum structural payload the aircraft can carry with sufficient fuel to achieve its design range, this is the 'sizing' mission.\n",
    "- **Maximum Fuel Point**: The maximum fuel the aircraft can hold with additional payload up to the aircraft's max takeoff weight. \n",
    "- **Ferry Range Point**: The maximum fuel the aircraft can carry with zero payload to achieve maximum possible range. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Payload Range Envelope Example](images/payload-range-envelope.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After a successfull sizing mission (**Maximum Payload Point**) the payload-range function calculates the required aircraft loading conditions and runs an off-design fallout mission for reach of the **Maximum Fuel Point** and **Ferry Range Points**. \n",
    "The fallout missions take payload, `phase_info` and `mission_mass` of the aircraft as inputs and solve for the maximum achievable range. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that the `phase_info` contains a standard climb, cruise, descent phases and Aviary will automatically adjust the `time_duration_bound` of the cruise phase to elongate the trajectory for the longer off-design missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "We highly recommend that users first read through [Off Design Missions](off_design_missions) to understand the underlying mechanics of how Aviary runs off-design missions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the system automatically recalculates the {glue:md}`total_payload_mass` for the off-design missions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maximum Fuel Point**: The payload is assumed to be proportionally reduced in all categories to accommodate for the additional fuel up to capacity. \n",
    "The `mission_mass` is set to the {glue:md}`design_gross_mass` of the sizing mission/Maximum Payload Point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ferry Range Point**: The payload is reduced to one passenger (due to off-design limitations) with the `mission_mass` argument set to the {glue:md}`operating_mass` plus {glue:md}`fuel_capacity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After which the **Maximum Fuel Point** and **Ferry Range Point** are run immediately after the **Maximum Payload Point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Aviary is structured to give a payload-range diagram even a **Maximum Fuel Point** is not feasable, in those cases just the **Maximum Payload Point** and **Ferry Range Point** are plotted. \n",

    "## Running a payload/range analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "### Input CSV File\n",
    "There are currently two methods to run a payload-range analysis. \n",
    "The first method is to add the following line to the Aviary inputs CSV file. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{glue:md} payload_range_toggle\n",
    ":format: myst\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "This will result in Aviary running a payload-range analysis every time that specific aircraft is sized. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manual Function Call\n",
    "The second method is to manually call the `run_payload_range()` function after running a sizing mission. \n",
    "If verbosity is set to 2 or higher, the function will print the payload-range values directly into the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(prob_fallout_max_fuel_plus_payload, prob_fallout_ferry) = prob.run_payload_range(verbosity=2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verbosity: optional parameter, default value = 1. \n",
    "    Prints payload-range to terminal if Verbosity â‰¥ 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a tuple containing two Aviary problem objects. \n",
    "- `prob_fallout_max_fuel_plus_payload`: off-design mission ran for the **Maximum Fuel Point**\n",
    "- `prob_fallout_ferry`: off-design mission configured for **Ferry Range Point**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output and visualization. \n",
    "The payload-range values are saved within the `payload_range_data.csv` file within the reports folder of the sizing mission's Aviary output directory. \n",
    "The information is also visualized within the `Payload/Range Diagram` tab in the Aviary dashboard for the sizing mission.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Aviary will only save and illustrate a payload/range analysis if the sizing and two off-design missions converged to a valid solution.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The user can then within the script used to run the sizing mission interrogate the off-design missions. \n",
    "An example of a payload/range being manually executed is available below. "

    "# Off-Design Missions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Off-design missions are missions that take an already designed and sized aircraft and attempt to run different mission trajectories, different payload quantities, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Off-design missions are enabled for the following mission types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* {glue:md}`height_energy`\n",
    "* {glue:md}`2DOF`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two types of off-design missions supported in Aviary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternate Missions: the mission's target range and aircraft payload mass are inputs and the fuel mass required is solved for. \n",
    "- Fallout Missions: the aircraft payload and gross mass as inputs and the range of the aircraft is solved for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The off-design missions correspond to the different problem types that can have differing objectives which are discussed in detail in [Level 2](../getting_started/onboarding_level2).\n",
    "The problem type determines what the optimizer can control to find a valid solution. \n",
    "- Sizing Missions allow the optimizer to control both the {glue:md}`summary_gross_mass` and {glue:md}`design_gross_mass` for the given mission and objective. \n",
    "- Alternate Missions allow the optimizer to only control the {glue:md}`summary_gross_mass` for the mission.\n",
    "- Fallout Missions don't allow the optimizer to control either {glue:md}`summary_gross_mass` or {glue:md}`design_gross_mass` but allows the optimizer to extend the range until the summary matches the design.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently 3 different methods for running an off-design mission within Aviary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first method is to take the input deck of an already sized aircraft and change its problem type to either `fallout` or `alternate`.    \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The user may need to revise some of the values in their input deck for the off-design mission.\n",
    "Since the aircraft is not re-designed, it is assumed that provided inputs constitute a valid aircraft.\n",
    "```\n",
    "The second method is to run off-design missions in the same script used to solve the design mission.\n",
    "An example of this is shown in {glue:md}`run_off_design_example.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third method is to run a sizing mission to design the aircraft, save the sizing information to a JSON file, then load the off-design mission in another script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If the sizing mission did not converge to a valid aircraft design, any off-design analysis will be invalid even if the off-design missions themselves converged.\n",
    "Therefore the validity of off-design analysis depends entirely on the validity of its source sizing mission.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-Design from an already sized aircraft. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first method of running an off-design mission requires that the user has an input deck of a fully sized and valid aircraft.\n",
    "ex: `aircraft_for_bench_FwFm.csv`.\n",
    "This is done by adding one of the following lines to its csv file:\n",
    "\n",
    "{glue:md}`fallout_snippet`\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "{glue:md}`alternate_snippet`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the problem type is specified, run Aviary as you would any other mission. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Off-design missions are run with the assumption that the sizing mission's {glue:md}`design_gross_mass` is the maximum structural mass the aircraft can support. \n",
    "However, Aviary is capable of running a converging off-design missions with {glue:md}`summary_gross_mass` that exceed that structural constraint. \n",
    "Therefore the user should check the {glue:md}`summary_gross_mass` of the off-design to ensure the optimization is valid. \n",
    "```\n",
    "## Sizing & off-design in the same script.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we highly recommend users first read through and understand the [Level 2](../getting_started/onboarding_level2) onboarding guide before attempting an off-design mission. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the Aviary Team's preferred method for running off-design missions as it allows the user to interrogate both the sizing and off-design missions together in the same script.\n",
    "Off-design functionality within the script involves first running a sizing mission then transferring the sizing parameters via JSON file into a new `AviaryProblem()` object.\n",
    "User input payload, `phase_info`, and `mission_mass` or `mission_range` is parsed to the new problem object and the problem is executed within the level 2 method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Running an off-design mission first requires a sizing mission setup similar to {glue:md}`run_level2_example.py` then the addition of `save_sizing_to_json()` to the `AviaryProblem`.\n",
    "- `prob.save_sizing_to_json(json_filename = 'sizing_problem.json')` \n",
    "\n",
    "The `save_sizing_to_json()` argument saves the sizing mission's parameters to a JSON filename of the user's choosing where `sizing_problem.json` is the default filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a fallout or alternate mission these level 2 functions can be added to the end of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `prob.fallout_mission(json_filename = 'sizing_problem.json')` \n",
    "\n",
    "- `prob.alternate_mission(json_filename = 'sizing_problem.json')`\n",
    "\n",
    "If an argument is left empty Aviary will assume it is the same as that of the sizing mission. \n",
    "Both off-design mission types take payload as an input parameter. \n",
    "The mission's payload is split up into the 3 passenger classes and the 2 cargo loadings. \n",
    "The respective Aviary variables are then updated with the user's off-design passenger and cargo quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note} \n",
    "As of v0.9.10 Aviary's off-design capabilities do not allow missions to be run with 0 passengers, so a minimum of 1 passenger must be specified. \n",
    "This is a known bug and is currently being investigated. \n",

    "# Using Aviary and OpenAeroStruct Together\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of an external subsystem using the [OpenAeroStruct (OAS)](https://github.com/mdolab/OpenAeroStruct) structural analysis system to perform aerostructural optimization of a typical large single aisle transport aircraft wing.\n",
    "The subsystem is based on the [OpenAeroStruct aerostructural optimization with wingbox](https://mdolab-openaerostruct.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/aerostructural_wingbox_walkthrough.html) example problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example performs a sub-optimization for minimum wing mass that is then used by Aviary.\n",
    "Another use case would be to perform a structural analysis only.\n",
    "Structural design variables would be passed to the subsystem from Aviary and wing mass and a constraint or constraints representing the structural analysis would be passed back to Aviary for use by the top level optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be a need for a higher fidelity tool to compute wing mass instead of relying on the empirical methods in core Aviary.\n",
    "A structural analysis external tool is usually used because of an unusual aircraft configuration that may not be predicted my Aviary empirical mass estimation methods, but in this example case it is simply a demonstration of an external capability to compute wing mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "## External Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The user must install [OpenAeroStruct](https://github.com/mdolab/OpenAeroStruct) into their Python environment using the command 'pip install openaerostruct'.\n",
    "The user must also install the [ambiance](https://ambiance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package using the command 'pip install ambiance'.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Subsystem Details\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to building an external subsystem -- the analysis tool and the Aviary external subsystem builder for that tool.\n",
    "The analysis tool takes inputs and parameters from Aviary and return outputs that Aviary can use to override existing variables.\n",
    "The subsystem builder uses the Aviary external subsystem builder template to connect the analysis tool to Aviary as either a pre-mission, mission or post-mission subsystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this case, the analysis tool will compute a wing mass in the pre-mission portion of the Aviary analysis and return its value to Aviary to override the empirical wing mass value.\n",
    "Fuel mass is passed in from Aviary as the only input currently, but other inputs may also be passed in through the subsystem builder, [OAS_wing_mass_builder](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/blob/main/aviary/examples/external_subsystems/OAS_mass/OAS_wing_mass_builder.py), by the {glue:md}`promotes_inputs` parameter.\n",
    "Other Aviary variables can also be added as additional inputs based on user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Some modifications of the [OAS_wing_mass_analysis](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/blob/main/aviary/examples/external_subsystems/OAS_mass/OAS_wing_mass_analysis.py) code will be necessary to add new inputs not already defined.\n",

    "The analysis code [OAS_wing_mass_analysis](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/blob/main/aviary/examples/external_subsystems/OAS_mass/OAS_wing_mass_analysis.py) contains the {glue:md}`OAStructures` class which performs a structural analysis of the wing. The image below shows a simplified XDSM diagram of the pre-mission data flow in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "![OAS XDSM](images/OAS_xdsm.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now discuss this code in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create a mesh that defines the shape of the wing based on the span, the location of the wing break typical of a transport aircraft, the dihedral and the wing root, wing break, and wing tip chord lengths.\n",
    "The twist of the wing is defined along the span at a set of control points and must be present as it is used in the optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then use this mesh to define a simplified finite element model of the wing structural box.\n",
    "We also define the airfoil shapes as an input to OpenAeroStruct for a given wing thickness to chord ratio (t/c) to represent the wing box thickness.\n",
    "We then set initial values for the wing skin thickness and spar thickness are set, along with material properties and stress allowables for a metal material, typically aluminum.\n",
    "OpenAeroStruct will then calculate aeroelastic loads for a 2.5g maneuver condition and apply those loads to the finite element model of the wing structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results of the structural optimization determine the optimum wing skin thickness, spar cap thickness, wing twist, wing t/c and maneuver angle of attack that satisfies strength constraints while minimizing wing mass.\n",
    "The 'OAStructures' class returns the optimized wing mass and the fuel mass burned but currently only the wing mass is used to override the Aviary variable 'Aircraft.Wing.MASS'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [OAS_wing_mass_analysis](https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/blob/main/aviary/examples/external_subsystems/OAS_mass/OAS_wing_mass_analysis.py) code may be executed in Python to test the OpenAeroStruct analysis outside of the Aviary subsystem interface.\n",
    "Default values for each of the inputs and options are included at the bottom of the analysis code file.\n",
    "This can be a useful test to demonstrate that the OpenAeroStruct analysis model has been properly defined and the model returns reasonable results.\n",

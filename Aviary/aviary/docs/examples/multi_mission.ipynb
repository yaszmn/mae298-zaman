    "# Multi-Mission Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Multi-mission Example](\n",
    "https://github.com/OpenMDAO/Aviary/tree/main/aviary/examples/multi_mission/run_multimission_example.py) demonstrates the capability to optimize a single aircraft design considering two missions that the aircraft will perform. For a background on this example see [Multi-Mission Overview](../user_guide/multi_mission). It is expected that the users is familiar with methods from level 1 and level 2 before exploring this content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "Each of the two missions in the example are instantiated as a single aviary problems with two AviaryGroups inside of it. Each AviaryGroup has it's own pre-missions, mission, and post-mission elements. Two get the pre-missions to have the same aircraft design, {glue:md}`Mission.Design.GROSS_MASS`, {glue:md}`Mission.Design.RANGE`, {glue:md}`Aircraft.Wing.SWEEP`, are promoted out of the pre-missions to a single values. This ensures that the aircrafts in both pre-missions have the same design even though their passenger count and fuel mass are different. There is no post-mission for the example, but if one was required for calculating cost or acoustic constraints, there would need to be two post-mission systems as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs for each mission are created and stored in the run_multimission_example folder. A custom print functions were added to display some important information. The user can see detailed info of each mission result using the `prob.model.mission1.list_vars()` commands listed in the comments at the bottom of the example. \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of checks exist in {glue:md}`add_aviary_group` which under the hood calls {glue:md}`check_and_preprocess_inputs` to help the user in the case that incomplete as-flow or design passenger information is provided. This was done to provide backward compatability for older aircraft models which only specify design passenger information. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we wanted to compare the same aircraft flying a mission with full passengers vs. a mission with no passengers. However, there are limitations in Aviary's ability to detect user input vs. default values. So we set the passenger count to one instead. Right now, the only way to set an aircraft to exactly zero passengers is by setting {glue:md}`Aircraft.CrewPayload.TOTAL_PAYLOAD_MASS` to zero plus any {glue:md}`Aircraft.CrewPayload.CARGO_MASS` being carried. This zeros out passenger and baggage mass regardless of what value is input to {glue:md}`Aircraft.CrewPayload.NUM_PASSENGERS`, {glue:md}`Aircraft.CrewPayload.NUM_TOURIST_CLASS`, {glue:md}`Aircraft.CrewPayload.NUM_BUSINESS_CLASS`, and {glue:md}`Aircraft.CrewPayload.NUM_FIRST_CLASS`. Once issue #610 is resolved the user should be able to set passenger and bags mass to exactly zero by setting {glue:md}`Aircraft.CrewPayload.PASSENGER_PAYLOAD_MASS` to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Pratices\n",
    "The user should be cognizant of the implications of having two pre-mission systems, one for each mission. When trying to mirror these to create a single aircraft that flies different missions, both of the pre-mission systems should be nearly identical in setup, except for fuel-mass, passenger, and payload calculations. There are numerous opportunities for the user to get this wrong, and accidentally create two different aircraft as a result. For example, in a previous iteration of this example, {glue:md}`Aircraft.Design.LANDING_TO_TAKEOFF_MASS_RATIO` was not specified, which resulted in two different landing gears being designed, one for mission1, one for mission2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: If you are having trouble getting your {glue:md}`Aircraft.Design.EMPTY_MASS` (the final drymass mass summation from pre-mission) to be equal for both pre-missions, use the following OpenMDAO commends at the end of the example to list out and compare the mass from each subsystem.\n",

We give each of the groups a name: mission1 and mission 2 which we will use to reference them later.

Up to this point, each call to {glue:md}`add_aviary_group` has setup two completely separate aircraft but in the example we are trying to design a single aircraft. To do this we must explicitly tell Aviary which key parameters are mirrored on both aircraft. These key parameters are used to size different subsystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "{glue:md}`promote_inputs` tells aviary that between mission1 and mission2, the following 3 values are the same and should be promoted to the top level of the problem: {glue:md}`Mission.Design.GROSS_MASS`, {glue:md}`Mission.Design.RANGE`, and {glue:md}`Aircraft.Wing.SWEEP`. If we did not promote these values, they would still only be accesible inside of their individual groups (i.e. mission1.mission:design:gross_mass). \n",
    "\n",
    "{glue:md}`add_design_var_default` is used to tell Aviary that we are setting `Aircraft1:GROSS_MASS` as a design variable controlled by the optimizer, and to set it's initial value and upper and lower constraints. Normally this is done as part of a two-step process using `prob.model.add_design_var` to set the range, and then after setup calling {glue:md}`prob.set_val` to set the initial value. However, it is more convenient to set them both in one place. The value can still be over-written later using {glue:md}`prob.set_val` after setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "{glue:md}`add_composite_objective` specifies that the output of {glue:md}`Mission.Summary.FUEL_BURNED` from `mission1` and `mission2` should be summed together based on a 2:1 weighting. Alternatively, the user could have specified the same thing using {glue:md}`add_composite_objective_adv` which provides a slightly more streamlined interface if users know their mission frequency and ouput weights separetly. This typically happens if you know how often you will fly a particular mission from historical data, and then you would like to weight the fuel-burn on each mission vs. another metric, such as maintinance costs."

    "The {glue:md}`Mission.Design.RANGE` value must be set to size some of Aviary's subsystems. These subsystems, such as avionics, have increasing mass as {glue:md}`Mission.Design.RANGE` increases. These are first order approximations that come with aviary. But because of these, we must ensure that both pre-missions have the same {glue:md}`Mission.Design.RANGE`, even if the actual range flown buy each mission (target_rage) is different. Without this, the avoinics mass calculated in pre-mission would be different for the two missions, resulting in a different aircraft design, which is counter to what is intended with the multi-mission feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "{glue:md}`set_design_range` method will access the phase_info for any missions supplied, find the largest `target_rage`, and set `Aircraft1:Range` to that value. This will ensure the avionics are designed similarly for both aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of passengers ({glue:md}`Aircraft.CrewPayload.Design.NUM_PASSENGERS`) and the design number of passengers of each type (business, tourist, first class), help to define the passenger air conditioning subsystems and the passenger support mass (seats) respectively. Thus when these values are set equal in mission1 and mission2, we ensure the aircraft will be designed similarly. These settings were already set in the `LargeSingleAisle2FLOPS` model which we are using.\n",

    "Note: It is good practice, but not required, to set {glue:md}`Aircraft.Design.LANDING_TO_TAKEOFF_MASS_RATIO` in Aviary Values to ensure consistent design of the landing gear for both missions. This combined with {glue:md}`Design.GROSS_MASS` helps to ensure that  {glue:md}`Aircraft.LandingGear.MAIN_GEAR_MASS` and {glue:md}`Aircraft.LandingGear.NOSE_GEAR_MASS` are the same for both missions. If {glue:md}`Aircraft.Design.LANDING_TO_TAKEOFF_MASS_RATIO` is not set, Landing Gear Masses will be caluclated based on {glue:md}`Mission.Summary.CRUISE_MACH` and {glue:md}`Mission.Design.RANGE`. This is potentially problematic because {glue:md}`Mission.Summary.CRUISE_MACH` may not be set, and instead cruse mach may be optimized. In that case, {glue:md}`Mission.Summary.CRUISE_MACH` could vary between mission1 and mission2, which would then cascade into differeing {glue:md}`Aircraft.LandingGear.MAIN_GEAR_MASS` which causes the aircraft designs to diverge.\n",

However, the {glue:md}`Mission.Summary.GROSS_MASS` varies as expected because these represent \"as-flown\" values. The full passengers mission (mission1) has the higher {glue:md}`Mission.Summary.GROSS_MASS`. Consequently, the {glue:md}`Mission.Summary.FUEL_BURNED` for each mission is different, higher for mission1, as expected because this mission is carrying more mass for the same mission. {glue:md}`Aircraft.Wing.SWEEP` is the same for both missions, indicating that the aircraft wings have been designed similarly in both cases.

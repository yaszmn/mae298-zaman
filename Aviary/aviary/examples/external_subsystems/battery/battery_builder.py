class BatteryBuilder(SubsystemBuilderBase):
    """
    Define the builder for a battery subsystem that provides methods to define the battery subsystem's states, design variables, fixed values, initial guesses, and mass names.
    It also provides methods to build OpenMDAO systems for the pre-mission and mission computations of the subsystem, to get the constraints for the subsystem, and to preprocess the inputs for the subsystem.

    As a contrast, The battery in the examples is a "simple" battery
    model which only tracks state-of-charge throughout the mission. This battery model is only an example, and is not used by any of Aviary's core subsystems (like the pycycle or OAS examples).
